# Hello_World
first repository on github! 
hello hello~ just going thru the tutorial. It's my junior year of highschool (AI with Gabor!) and this seems kinda hard rn but so did after effects so bring it on github! hell yeah! 

anyways I'm trying to build up some sort of portfolio, hopefully a lot in python, maybe some java. 

haha I hope this makes me better at this stuff 

college apps r scary things ;_; 


(if things are going better then maybe it was worth it?)

Was it worth it?
